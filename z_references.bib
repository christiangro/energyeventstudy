Do tail events in the home country trigger extreme responses by foreign investors – are foreign investors ‘fair weather friends’? In this, is there asymmetry between the response of foreign investors to very good versus very bad days? Do foreign investors have a major impact on domestic markets through large inﬂows or outﬂows – are they ‘big ﬁsh in a small pond’? Do extreme events in world markets induce extreme behaviour by foreign investors, thus making them vectors of crisis transmission? We propose a modiﬁed event study methodology focused on tail events, which yields evidence on these questions. The results, for India, do not suggest that ﬁnancial globalization has induced instability on the equity market.},

To answer this question, the significant cycles were discovered using the Fourier analysis inside the price series of US stocks; then, the simulation of an agent buying and selling on minima and maxima of these cycles was made. The results were then compared to those of an agent operating chaotically. Moreover, the existing significant cycles were found using more precise methods, suggested in the research, and based on the results of an agent buying and selling on all possible periods and phases. It has been analysed whether these really existing cycles were in accordance with the significant cycles resulting from the Fourier analysis. It has been concluded that the Fourier analysis basically failed. Suchlike failures are expected on similar data series. In addition, momentum and level trading backtests have been used in a similar way. It has been found that the level trading does provide a certain practical value in comparison to the momentum trading method. The research also simplifies the complicated theoretical background for practitioners.},

Simulations with daily security return data show that the sign test is better specified under the null hypothesis and often more powerful under the alternative hypothesis than a /-test. The performance of the sign test is dominated by the performance of a rank test, however, indicating that the rank test is preferable to the sign test in obtaining nonparametric inferences concerning abnormal security price performance in event studies.},

	abstract = {Engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts are on the way to become the most usual form of contracting applied by the private sector to undertake construction works on large scale infrastructure projects. In every project, it is necessary to have good contract management in place; otherwise it can have negative consequences for all parties involved – the client, contractor, lenders, government, etc. If contract management is not implemented and controlled properly, it may have a negative impact on the project as a whole. Such failures may include a delayed schedule, cost overruns, quality, safety and more. Nowadays, some contractors refuse to enter into EPC contracts in certain jurisdictions, since a number of contractors suffered from heavy losses in the past. A qualitative approach was applied in order to analyze the critical points of contracts based upon reviews of related case studies from the power sector and supplementary interviews with business professionals. This research study identifies the key clauses and pitfalls causing the majority of disputes in EPC contracts and provides the description of these conditions in order to increase their common understanding. In addition to that, the key factors of successful project completion under the EPC contract scheme were defined. It was also found that the EPC contracting scheme could work very well for power projects, especially in the cases where the contractor is in a good position to understand all legal aspects of the contract, including the allocation of risks.},

In doing so, the study discusses different parametric as well as nonparametric testing procedures available in the literature. Reviewing the prior literature reveals that the nonparametric sign and rank tests are better specified than parametric procedures. However, in case of detecting the short-run anomalies, we document that nonparametric tests have higher power relative to standard parametric approaches.},

An event study of investor meetings/presentations held by listed Danish ﬁrms is conducted. The article ﬁnds signiﬁcantly positive abnormal returns a few days around investor meetings as well as increased variance. Share turnover reaches maximum 1 day after investor meetings. This indicates the presence of possible insider trading. The introduction of common EU rules dealing explicitly with investor meetings is suggested in order to improve investor protection. The use of webcasting of investor meetings over the Internet is strongly recommended.},

The acquisitions of firms related to financial technologies are one of the ways to obtain vital knowledge. In order to identify the fintech companies we are looking at firms that are involved in business activities in both the IT and financial sectors. By examining the growing role of fintech firms in the recent mergers and acquisitions from an investor point of view, this paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating the post-acquisition performance of the acquirer firms measured by abnormal returns. We discovered significant positive average abnormal return after acquisition of fintech companies in the short-term and negative average abnormal return in the long-term using event study methodology. The specifics of cross-border acquisitions, the level of the domestic market development of the acquirer, and other characteristics of M\&A deals are considered in order to explain the reaction of investors to announcements of fintech firms’ acquisitions. The determinants of corresponding M\&A deals in emerging and developed markets were revealed.},

However, these initial price reactions are incomplete.
