## Background

- @Kothari_2004 reporting 15 years ago over 500 event studies  

- event studies first by @Fama_1969  

- daily stock prices by @Brown_1985  

    - also proposed taking market adjusted returns.  
    
\  
    
- Key assumptions  

  - efficient market hypothesis is valid (@Werner_2010)  

  - winning a contract always results in a positive market reaction (@Choi_2015)  

  - investors:  

    - buy or sell based on company press releases  
  
    - have no detailed knowledge of project worth  
  
    - often read press releases  
  
    - valuate according to power stated (MW)  
  
    - exhibit similar behaviors across continents  
  
    - regard all companies as equal

# Method & Calculation

## Equations

To calculate the market adjusted returns $A_{i,t}$:

\begin{equation}
  A_{i,t} = R_{i,t} - R_{m,t}
\end{equation}

Where $R_{i,t}$ is the return of security $i$ at day $t$, and $R_{m,t}$ is the return of index $m$ on day $t$. This expression is then augmented to the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) market model:

\begin{equation}
  A_{i,t} = R_{i,t} - \hat{\alpha_{i}} -  \hat{\beta_{i}}R_{m,t}
\end{equation}

Where $\hat{\alpha_{i}}$ and $\hat{\beta_{i}}$ are OLS values from the estimation period, which is a defined period in the months before the event where the tendency is estimated.


```{r z-estimation-beamer, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics("z_estimation_period.png")
```

## Alternative hypothesis

The resulting Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR) from the event study is then used in a simple regression with equations adapted from @empirical and @regres.

The null hypothesis to be rejected is:
\begin{equation}
  H_{0}: \beta_{0} = \beta_{1} = 0
\end{equation}
when 
\begin{equation}
  Pr(>|t|) < 0.05
\end{equation}
Similarly, the alternative hypothesis to be accepted is:
\begin{equation}
  H_{A}: \beta_{0} \neq 0 \vee \beta_{1} \neq 0
\end{equation}
for a simple regression 
\begin{equation}
  y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x + u
\end{equation}

\begin{tiny}

where

$Pr(>|t|)$ = *p-value*, results are significant if less than 0.05.

$y$ = Estimate of the dependent variable, Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR).

$\beta_{0}$ = y-axis intersect, CAR.

$\beta_{1}$ = Slope of the regression.

$x$ = Independent variable, e.g. Megawatts mentioned, cluster size.

$u$ = error term, not directly visible on plots.

\end{tiny}

## Linear method

R determines the simple regression with a linear method which solves via QR decomposition as described in detailed by @lminr and @linpack:

for a simple regression  
\begin{equation}
 y = \cancel{\beta_{0}} + \beta_{1}x + \cancel{u}
\end{equation}

since a linear system $b=Ax$ is equivalent to a system of matrix $A$ and diagonal matrices with scaling factors $D_r,D_c$:  

\begin{equation}
D_rb=(D_rAD_c)(D_{c}^{-1}x)
\end{equation}

where some values are passed to (at least one) coefficient matrix $X$:
\begin{equation}
 X^Ty = X^TX\beta
\end{equation}

This is subjected to a QR decomposition:
\begin{equation}
 X = QR, Q\ othogonal, R\ upper\ triangular
\end{equation}

For the equation with only $\beta$ unknown:
\begin{equation}
 R\beta=Q^Ty
\end{equation}

with the R upper triangular of the matrices found with householder reflections.

The QR decomposition is then solved for the least squares solution.

The 9-11 terrorist attacks were used because:

- clear market signals  

- various market exchanges  

- international  

- similar number of securities involved  

- event window starts on a weekend

\  

Differences between the packages:  

\  

- *EventStudyTools.com* (page 18)  

  - does not start at zero    
  
  - abnormal returns start before the weekend  
  
    - this is outside the event window  
    
  - analysis starts before event window begins  
  
    - compensates for missing data  
    
\  

- *R eventstudies* (page 20)  

  - zero at beginning of event window  
  
  - accounts for the weekend  
  
  - zero abnormal returns after weekend  
  
    - results adjusted to zero after weekend  

\  

- *R estudy 2*  (page 21)  

  - starts later than other packages  
  
    - does not account for the weekend  
    
    - only calculates results when available

## Hypotheses

- Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR) from day 2 is taken  

- various alternative hypotheses were derived

- two looked at in detail

  - increased CAR for higher power generation value mentioned,  
  
    - and when adjusted for Market Capitalization  
    
\  

\  

Additionally, a couple of relationships were examined with box plots

  - increased CAR by energy generation type  
  
  - increased CAR by company

# Results & Discussion

## Changed data entries 

- 1 result has been changed and 2 excluded

\  

- changed result is typing mistake on date which caused wrong month  
    - solar, Marubeni, UAE(Asia, 800 MW), changed to January from February  
    
\  

- two further data samples excluded  

  - study assumes results only from company websites  
  
  - results were published on external websites  
  
  - no record found on company website at similar date.  
  
  - therefore had to be removed from the results  

    - LNGT, Samsung C&T, Vietnam / Asia, 109 MUSD (small influence)  

    - Gas Turbine, Siemens, Bangladesh / Asia, 3600 MW (Big influence)

\  

Differences to results in thesis  

\  

- slope of turbine is "significant"  

  - discounted since was insignificant before  
    
- solar regression has different values  

\  

Assumptions for regression against Megawatt  

\  

- results impartial to generation type  

- scope of supply is ambiguous  

  - no subjective scope of supply  

  - would presume non-public information   

\  

Heterogeneous group sizes  

\  

- only group with a large enough size is gas turbines ("Turbine")  

- groups have too different tendencies to be assessed in unity  

- simple regression against Megawatt shows the best characteristics

\  

Assumptions for regression against MCAP  

\  

- significance of Megawatt is proportional to market capitalization (MCAP)  

  - investors relate announcement to MCAP   
  
  - announcement more important to small company
    
\  

Results contrary to assumptions  

\  

- less relationship when MCAP is accounted for  

  - better estimate when ignoring MCAP  

  - company knowledge weakens relationship  

  - undermines assumption that announcement on company website is important

Frequent company announcements  

\  
  
- results in significant clustering  

- @Brown_1980, clustering:  
  
  - increases the variance  
  
  - decreases the power of the tests  
  
\  

Main shortfall of study is excessive clustering

- more clustering within estimation window

Clustering determined via web scraping

::::

:::: column  

CAR from all company announcements  

\  

- results from figure 24  

- gathered to determine clustering  

- collection of thousands of announcements  

- announcements neither assessed nor factored  

\  

Near comprehensive listing from websites  

\  

  - Samsung filters some announcements  
  
  - Shanghai Electric publishes Ansaldo Energía separately  

- displays parametric distribution  


\  

No relationship between size of cluster and abnormal returns  

\  

- increasing number of results without evaluation has no effect  
  
\ 

No two-tailed distribution when no simultaneous events  

\  

- announcements without evaluation have no effect

# Conclusion

## Conclusion

Results are not conclusive

\  

- @Schiereck_2012, @Choi_2015 show significant results  

\  

- too little data, too much clustering of events  

\  

- different group sizes restrict sufficient sample size  

\  

- could be an error in the programming
